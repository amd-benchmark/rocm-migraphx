Recipes for poor man's tuning of MIOpen for MIGraphX with a docker
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Step #1 - Capture the convolution kernels with two steps:
   - Turn on MIOpen command logging:
     export MIOPEN_ENABLE_LOGGING_CMD=1

   - Turn off MIGraphX fusions:
     export MIGRAPHX_DISABLE_MIOPEN_FUSION=1

   NOTE: MIGraphX fusions need to be turned off because MIOpen library does
         not log fused convolutions.

   Make sure stderr files are captured somewhere since this is where the
   logfiles go.

   As a practical example, passing "-e MIOPEN_ENABLE_LOGGING_CMD=1" and
   "-e MIGRAPHX_DISABLE_MIOPEN_FUSION=1" on docker runs seems to do what
   is necessary.  See ../scripts/run_ort_migraphx.sh as an example.

2. Harvest the MIOpen convolution operators into a script.
